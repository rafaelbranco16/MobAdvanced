# MobAdvanced

üìñ Overview

MobAdvanced brings a new light to less experienced players of different MOBA-type games by using what is new on the market, artificial intelligence. Until now, there was applications that provide this help through professional players or a huge community that wanted to help. But sometimes the fun is lost in the repetition of games when they all look the same. With the help of MobAdvanced, it will be possible to ask for builds to help with the development of the game with items that you probably never used. Let the artificial intelegence think for you. Let it be as creative as humans could. Use your creativity for it to use theirs!

‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

This command will create an environment with all the libraries. After just use

    ./run.sh

or

    python3 start.py

To run the app.

üí´ The future

In the humble opinion of the creator, a bright future cannot be taken as granted. This is a system with a lot of variables that are not affordable, yet. But what the future waits is not the only thing that can be earned or achieved with this project. This project waits for more fun than usage! 

The future is fun, but ambiguous. Take this as a game and have the fun you want with it. Your game will be as allucinated as you can make it. Your game will be as good as you can make it!
